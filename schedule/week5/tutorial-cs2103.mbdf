#### {{ thumb(1) }} Discuss the code quality of iP PRs

<!--div class="indented">

{{ icon_team }} This activity is to be done as a team. One team member needs to be connected to the TV.
</div -->

1. **Find the PR you have been allocated to discuss** (given below). If the allocated PR is not available or suitable, you can choose the fallback option, and failing that, any random PR.

   <panel header="PR allocation">

   {% macro get_links(username) -%}
   [{{ username }}'s PR](https://github.com/{{ module_org }}/{{ ip_repo_name }}/pulls/{{ username }})
   {%- endmacro  %}

   Your username | PR to review       | Fallback PR to review
   --------------|--------------------|------------------
   {% for allocation in allocations  -%}
   {{ allocation[0] }} | {{ get_links(allocation[1]) }} | {{ get_links(allocation[2]) }}
   {% endfor %}
   </panel>

1. {{ timing_badge("10 minutes", "info") }} **Find potential _abstraction_ problems**: Go through the code in the dif view (i.e., the <span class="tab">:octicon-diff: Files changed</span> tab), and and find potential ==abstraction problems (weak SLAP, arrow-head style code, too-long methods, too-deep nesting)== <br/>
   {{ icon_tip }} To identify long methods or deep nesting, zoom out and scroll through the entire PR code to do a visual inspection (no need to read the code line-by-line). After visually locating a method that looks too long/deep, have a closer look to see it can be improved by using better abstraction.If you are unsure about a case, you can also rope the tutor in to the discussion.
   * If you can't find at least one example, you can try the fallback option provided, and failing that, another random iP PR.
   * You can also select borderline cases.
   * **Paste screenshots of problematic code** in the shared online document provided (in the section of the document allocated to you).

1. {{ timing_badge("10 minutes", "info") }} **Discussion**: The tutor will lead a short discussion to go through the problematic code you found.

1. {{ icon_tip }} **After the tutorial**, you can apply the insights gained from this activity to **improve the code quality of your own iP**, if necessary.


#### {{ thumb(2) }} Prioritize tP user stories

* Show your list of tP user stories to the tutor %%(for progress tracking)%%.
* If you haven't done so already, prioritize tP user stories as explained in the panel below.
