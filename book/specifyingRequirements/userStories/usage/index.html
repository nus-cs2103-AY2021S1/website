                      <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early stages of requirements gathering</strong>.</p>

                        <p>Given below is a possible <em>recipe</em> you can take when using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering.</p>
                        <p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> <strong>Define the <em>target user</em> as a <em>persona</em>:</strong></p>
                        <p>Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even narrow it down to a <em>persona</em>. Here is an example:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                          <p>Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> <strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong></p>
                        <p>Decide the exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. It is also useful to specify what related problems it will <em>not</em> solve so that the exact scope is clear.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                          <p>ProductX helps Jean keep track of all her school contacts. It does not cover communicating with contacts.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> <strong>List <em>scenarios</em> to form a <em>narrative</em>:</strong></p>
                        <p>Think of the various likely scenarios your target user is likely to go through as she uses your app. Following a chronological sequence as if you are telling a story might be helpful.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                          <p><strong>A. First use:</strong></p>

                        <p>Based on the scenarios, decide user stories you need to support each. For example, based on the scenario 'A. First use', you might have user stories such as these:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                          <ul>
                            <li>As a potential user exploring the app, I can see the app populated with sample data, so that I can easily see how the app will look like when it is in use.</li>
                            <li>As a user ready to start using the app, I can purge all current data, so that I can get rid of sample/experimental data I used for exploring the app.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>To give another example, based on the scenario 'D. 100th use', you might have user stories such as these:</p>

                          <ul>
                            <li>As an expert user, I can create shortcuts for tasks, so that I can save time on frequently performed tasks.</li>
                            <li>As a long-time user, I can archive/hide unused data, so that I am not distracted by irrelevant data.</li>

                        <p><mark>Do not 'evaluate' the value of user stories while brainstorming</mark>. <span class="dimmed">Reason: an important aspect of brainstorming is not judging the ideas generated.</span></p>
                        <p><strong><strong>Other tips:</strong></strong></p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong>
                            Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
                          <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br>
                            For example, consider this user story: <code v-pre>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>
                            When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
                          <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br>
                            When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like. That is, don't try to reverse-engineer a preconceived product idea into user stories.</li>
                          <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br>
                            When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>

                      <blockquote>
                        <p>One of the biggest misunderstandings with user stories is how they differ from traditional requirements specifications. The biggest difference is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make a reasonably low risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story developers will go to the customer and receive a detailed description of the requirements face to face.</p>
