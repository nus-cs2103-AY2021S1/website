* **Record a demo** of all the product features, in a reasonable order.
  * You may choose to screen record each feature and tie it up (see the  "Suggested tools" below for options), OR
  * Schedule + record a zoom meeting within the team, where you share your screens and do the demo.
* **The quality of the demo will not affect marks** as long as it serves the purpose (i.e., demonstrates the product features). Hence, don't waste too much time on creating the video.
* **Audio explanations** are strongly encouraged (but not compulsory) -- alternatively, you can switch between slides and the app to give additional explanations.
* **Annotations and other enhancements** to the video are optional (those will not earn any extra marks).
* **All members taking part** in the demo video is encouraged but not compulsory.
* **File name:** `[TEAM_ID][product Name].mp4`  %%e.g.[{{ example_team_id }}][Contacts Plus].mp4%% (other video formats are acceptable but use a format that works on all major OS'es).
* **File size:** Recommended to keep below 200MB. You can use a low resolution as long as the video is in usable quality.
* **Submission:** Submit to LumiNUS (different folder).
* **Deadline:** 2 days after the main deadline
* **Suggested tools:**
  * Ink2Go: You can use this to record your screen and annotate if necessary. [Here](https://wiki.nus.edu.sg/display/cit/Ink2go+Instructions+for+Students) are some instructions from NUS CIT to help you get started.
  * [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/): A free/open-source tool to help convert videos to MP4.

#### <span class="badge badge-info">Demo</span> <span class="text-info">Duration</span>

* **Strictly 18 minutes for a 5-person team, 15 minutes for a 4-person team**, 21 minutes for a 6-person team. Exceeding this limit will be penalized.
<!--
* **An additional 5 minutes will be given to set up** i.e., you will be given access to the demo station 5 minutes before your allocated start time.~~
-->

#### <span class="badge badge-info">Demo</span> <span class="text-info">Target audience</span>

* **Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company**, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product. This is the first time they are seeing the new product you developed. The actual audience are the evaluators (the team supervisor and another tutor).

#### <span class="badge badge-info">Demo</span> <span class="text-info">Scope</span>

* ==**Start by giving an overview of the product**== so that the evaluators get a sense of the full picture early. Include the following:
  * **What** is it? %%e.g., FooBar is a product to ensure the user takes frequent standing-breaks while working.%%
  * **Who** is it for? %%e.g., It is for someone who works at a PC, prefers typing, and wants to avoid prolonged periods of sitting.%%
  * **How** does it help? Give an overview of how the product's features help to solve the target problem for the target user

<div class="indented-level2">
<box>

Here is an example:
```{.no-line-numbers}
Hi, welcome to the demo of our product FooBar. It is a product to ensure the user takes
frequent standing-breaks while working.
It is for someone who works at a PC, prefers typing, and wants to avoid prolonged periods
of sitting.
The user first sets the parameters such as frequency and targets, and then enters a
command to record the start of the sitting time, ... The app shows the length of the
sitting periods, and alerts the user if ...
...
```
</box>
</div>

* There is no need to introduce team members or explain who did what. %%Reason: to save time.%%
<!--
* It is fine for one member (or only some members) to take part in creating the video, although sharing the load among team members is encourages.
* **Each person should do a fair share of the demo**. However, it's OK for one member to do all the typing.
* **There is no need for each person to demo their own work**.
-->
* **Present the features in a reasonable order**: Organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole, presented in a logical order.
* **No need to cover design/implementation details** as the manager is not interested in those details.

#### <span class="badge badge-info">Demo</span> <span class="text-info">Structure</span>

* **Demo the product using the same executable** you submitted <!--, on your own laptop, using the TV.-->
* **Use a sufficient amount of <tooltip content="`Mr aaa` is not a realistic person name">_realistic_</tooltip> demo data.** %%e.g at least 20 data items%%. Trying to demo a product using just 1-2 sample data creates a bad impression.
<!--
* **It can be a _sitting down_ demo.** You'll be demonstrating the features using the TV while sitting down. But you may stand around the TV if you prefer that way.
* **It will be an uninterrupted demo.** The audience members will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish within the given time.
* **Dress code**: The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.
-->

#### <span class="badge badge-info">Demo</span> <span class="text-info">Tips</span>

* **Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create.** For example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to perform a task before you show the full command with all the bells and whistles.

<!--
* **Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product.** Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations.
Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales pitch or an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an imaginary user. For example,<br>
[Instead of this] `Jim get’s a call from boss. "Ring ring", "hello", "oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?" "Sure". Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.`<br>
[do this] `If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …`<br>
It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it.
Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different context → Different requirements.
* **Showcase how the feature improves the user’s life** rather than simply describe each feature.
* **Rehearse the steps well** and ensure you can do a smooth demo. ==Find a [_golden path_](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sleight-hand-white-lies-bottle-scotch-how-apple-pulled-off-first-iphone-launch-1600085) and stick to it==. Poor quality demos can affect your grade.
* **Don’t waste time repeating things the target audience already knows.** e.g. no need to say things like "We are students from NUS, SoC".
* **No need to introduce next presenter** at the end of your part %%Reason: to save time%%.


#### <span class="badge badge-info">Demo</span> <span class="text-info">Special circumstances</span>

* **If a significant feature was not merged on time:** inform the tutor and get permission to show the unmerged feature using your own version of the code. Obviously, unmerged features earn much less marks than a merged equivalent but something is better than nothing.
* **If you are unable to come to the demo due to a valid reason**, submit the evidence of your excuse %%e.g., MC%% to prof. The demo is part of module grading and ==absence without a valid reason== will cause you to lose marks.
