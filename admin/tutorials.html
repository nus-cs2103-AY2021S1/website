                  <p><strong>Not a source of admin information</strong>: Given the humongous amount of admin info contained in this module and the fact that it is constantly evolving, tutors may not be aware of the recent subtle changes to the admin information. To safeguard you from receiving incorrect admin info, tutors are prohibited from answering admin queries. If you have an admin query, please post in the <a href="https://github.com/nus-tic4001-AY2021S1/forum/issues">forum</a> (or email the prof at <code v-pre>tic4001@comp.nus.edu.sg</code> but only if the question is not appropriate for the forum).</p>

                <li>
                  <p><strong>No direct tech help</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from giving direct technical help, other than to give you some general direction to finding a solution. <span class="dimmed">Rationale: We want you to learn the vital survival skill of troubleshooting technical problems.</span></p>

                    <p><strong>Keep in mind that instructors don't have ready solutions to all technical problems</strong>. Unlike tutorial questions for which instructors have model solutions, given the complexity of industry tools we use (Gradle, GitHub, Git, ...) and the rapid pace they are updated, instructors don't have ready solutions to most technical problems you face in this module. The only realistic way to solve those problems at a large scale is crowd-sourcing i.e., someone else who faced a similar problem might know how to fix it.</p>

                      <li><span class="text-danger"><strong>Send a help request to an instructor</strong>:</span> When faced with a technical problem or a doubt about a concept, don't fire off an email lecturer/tutor immediately, unless it is something only the lecturer/tutor is supposed to know.<br></li>

                        <p><strong>Double-check the given instructions</strong>: Often, technical problems arise due to deviations in how you perform a step or a difference in your environment.<br></p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><strong>Get your team to meet for a weekly work-together session</strong>. When you do module tasks together, it is easy to compare with each other and figure out what deviation is causing the problem. That is, crowd-source your team first.</p>

                      <li>
                        <p><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't give an opportunity for someone to ask you to <a href="http://www.jibble.org/stfw/">STFW</a>.<br>
                          Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains hints as to how to fix the problem. Even if not, a web search on the error message is a good starting point.  <br>

                            <p><strong>Give full details of the problem</strong> Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is relevant to your problem, your chances of getting an answer in the first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can help you, it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.</p>

                              <li>Include full error message, screenshots, code snippets, stack traces, etc.<br></li>
                              <li>If the problem is code-related, share the code if possible (e.g., push the current state of the code to a branch in your fork and give the link to the branch). That gives a chance for someone to reproduce the state of your project in their computer.</li>

                            <p><strong>Isolate the problem.</strong> &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going to help even if you post the whole code. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and strip it down to the bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself (have you heard about <span trigger="click" for="modal:appendixHelp-rubberDuckDebugging" v-b-popover.click.top.html="popoverGenerator" v-b-tooltip.click.top.html="tooltipContentGetter" v-on:click="$refs['modal:appendixHelp-rubberDuckDebugging'].show()" class="trigger-click">Rubber Duck Debugging</span>?).</p>

                      <p><em>Rubber duck debugging</em> is an informal term used in software engineering to refer to a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug his code by forcing himself to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.</p>

                <li><strong>No leading from the front</strong>: Tutors are not expected to lead your project effort. They will not tell you how or when to do project tasks. You have to figure those out yourselves. But tutors will give you feedback on how you are doing project tasks so that you can improve further.</li>

                <li>Please refer to the <span><a href="/website/schedule/index.html">Schedule page</a></span> for further details on each tutorial.</li>
                <li>You are expected to be present on time. <mark>Punctuality is considered for participation marks.</mark></li>

              <ul>
                <li>In the past, many students have requested to increase the tutorial duration because a mere hour is barely enough to get through all the tutorial tasks. Increasing the tutorial time is not possible due to lack of venues and tutors. Instead, let's try to make the best of the one hour available by coming well prepared and starting on time. Note that <mark>the better prepared you are, the higher the chance of completing e all activities allocated to a tutorial</mark> within time.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Your conduct in tutorials will be evaluated by team members and the tutor which can affect your participation marks.</li>
