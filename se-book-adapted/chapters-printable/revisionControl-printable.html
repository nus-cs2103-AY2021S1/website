                      <blockquote>
                        <p><strong><em>Revision control</em> is the process of managing multiple versions of a piece of information.</strong> In its simplest form, this is something that many people do by hand: every time you modify a file, save it under a new name that contains a number, each one higher than the number of the preceding version.</p>
                        <p>Manually managing multiple versions of even a single file is an error-prone task, though, so software tools to help automate this process have long been available. The earliest automated revision control tools were intended to help a single user to manage revisions of a single file. Over the past few decades, the scope of revision control tools has expanded greatly; they now manage multiple files, and help multiple people to work together. The best modern revision control tools have no problem coping with thousands of people working together on projects that consist of hundreds of thousands of files.</p>
                        <p><strong>Revision control software will track the history and evolution of your project</strong>, so you don't have to. For every change, you'll have a log of who made it; why they made it; when they made it; and what the change was.</p>
                        <p><strong>Revision control software makes it easier for you to collaborate</strong> when you're working with other people. For example, when people more or less simultaneously make potentially incompatible changes, the software will help you to identify and resolve those conflicts.</p>
                        <p><strong>It can help you to recover from mistakes</strong>. If you make a change that later turns out to be an error, you can revert to an earlier version of one or more files. In fact, a really good revision control tool will even help you to efficiently figure out exactly when a problem was introduced.</p>
                        <p><strong>It will help you to work simultaneously on, and manage the drift between, multiple versions of your project.</strong> Most of these reasons are equally valid, at least in theory, whether you're working on a project by yourself, or with a hundred other people.</p>

                  <p><strong><mark><em>Branching</em></mark> is the process of evolving multiple versions of the software in parallel.</strong> For example, one team member can create a new branch and add an experimental feature to it while the rest of the team keeps working on another branch. Branches can be given names e.g. <code v-pre>master</code>, <code v-pre>release</code>, <code v-pre>dev</code>.</p>
                  <p><strong>A branch can be <mark><em>merged</em></mark> into another branch.</strong> Merging usually result in a new commit that represents the changes done in the branch being merged.</p>

                  <p><strong><mark><em>Merge conflicts</em></mark> happen when you try to merge two branches that had changed the same part of the code</strong> and the RCS software cannot decide which changes to keep. In those cases you have to âresolveâ those conflicts manually.</p>

                  <p><strong>RCS can be done in two ways: the <em>centralized</em> way and the <em>distributed</em> way.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Centralized RCS (CRCS for short) uses a central remote repo that is shared by the team.</strong> Team members download (âpullâ) and upload (âpushâ) changes between their own local repositories and the central repository. Older RCS tools such as CVS and SVN support only this model. Note that these older RCS do not support the notion of a local repo either. Instead, they force users to do all the versioning with the remote repo.</p>

                  <p></p>
                  <p><strong>Distributed RCS (DRCS for short, also known as Decentralized RCS) allows multiple remote repos</strong> and pulling and pushing can be done among them in arbitrary ways. The workflow can vary differently from team to team. For example, every team member can have his/her own remote repository in addition to their own local repository, as shown in the diagram below. Git and Mercurial are some prominent RCS tools that support the distributed approach.</p>

                  <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                  <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, letâs assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.<br>
                      <font color="red"><big><span aria-hidden="true" class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span></big></font> Common mistake: Done the proposed changes in the <code v-pre>master</code> branch -- if Jean does that, she will not be able to have more than one open PR at any time because any changes to the <code v-pre>master</code> branch will be reflected in all open PRs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                    <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                    <li>Other members review Jeanâs pull request.</li>
                    <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                    <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jeanâs code to the main repo.</li>
                    <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.<br>
                      <font color="red"><big><span aria-hidden="true" class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span></big></font> Possible mistake: Creating another 'reverse' PR from the team repo to team member fork to syn the member's fork with the merged code. PRs are meant to go from downstream repos to upstream repos, not in the other direction.
                    </li>
